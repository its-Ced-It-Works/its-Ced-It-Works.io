Hi I'm Cedrick. This is my personal webpage!

# Purpose
To create an online CV to display technical and design skills, as well as to learn good git hygiene habits.  This online CV is hosted via github pages using a github repository.

# Requirements
A github account and knowledge of github.
Git locally installed on your computer. 
An internet connection.
A basic understanding of how to use git/github desktop.
An IDE/code editor like Visual Studio Code.

# Starting Guide
On your github profile page, navigate to your repositories.
Create a new repository, with the name “username.github.io”. This name is your github.pages url. When creating the repository initialize it with a readme file and enter a description for your repository.
Open your “username.github.io” repository and navigate to its settings, once there find the github pages section. Enable github pages for this repository. A link in the form https://username.github.io will be displayed.
Click on this link, you will be then be directed to your github.pages site with your readme displayed in plain html. Congratulations you’ve successfully hosted your own webpage!
For more information regarding cloning and contributing to your webpage repository, github and the internet is your friend. I know this sounds like a cop out, but this is seriously how you’ll learn more :)

# Issues and Solutions 
Be weary of corporate internet. Often their proxy settings, or general firewall rules can prevent you viewing github pages or even using the github desktop client to clone/fetch repositories. The only work around for both issues that I’ve found is use home internet or mobile data when you want to view these pages. If you are comfortable with the terminal/command prompt you shouldn’t encounter issues related to corp-wifi when using the git CLI to clone/fetch/push repositories.
Raw HTML and CSS can be frustrating to work with, there exist frameworks and libraries to create commonly used webpage elements. W3schools and bootstrap is all you need for that, while some JS skills are necessary, for the most part you can get by with the first two mentioned.

 
# Its-Ced-It-Works Rationale
It’s become evident that having code that shows what you do outweighs what a piece of paper says you can do. This is an attempt at that. This webpage repository, and the containing persona, its-ced-it-works, is to be a transparent display of skill, thought, design and to ultimately speak on my behalf. My overarching goal with this webpage is to provide a means of learning, while I have fun with it.
